This is a figure for the cure u01 grant application. We got the data from someone else, but their graph wasn't good so I am re-making it. They sent the data+graph+info all in one file so I took out just the data and put it in a .csv file to read into R.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
library(swarm)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

#This is the data set with summarized data from each donor.
all_donors_dat <- read.csv("qVOA figure/qVOA_figure_all_donors_data_only.csv")



#in order to be able to make the shape of the plot depend on whether the donor is AB9105 or some other donor, I'm adding a column to indicate that so I can refer to it in the ggplot2 call



all_donors_dat<- all_donors_dat %>%
  mutate(Detail = ifelse(Donor == "AB9105", "Yes","No"))

#also FH wants there to be a dark grey strip text title like for facetted plots. There isn't anything to facet on so I'll just make a column where all entries are the text I want in the strip and then facet on that to get the strip text



all_donors_dat <- all_donors_dat %>%
  mutate(strip_text = "14 HIV+ donors \n\ on suppressive ART")


all_donors_plot<-ggplot(all_donors_dat, aes(x = "", y = IUPM))+
  
geom_point(aes(shape = Detail),position = position_swarm(0.07), size = 1.5)+
  
labs(x = "") + 
  
scale_shape_manual(values = c("No" = 2, "Yes" = 16))+
guides(shape = FALSE)+
  
facet_wrap(~strip_text)+
  
scale_y_log10(breaks = c(0.1, 1, 10),limits = c(0.1,15), labels = c("0.1","1","10"))+
  
theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 10), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

#this is the data set with "representative viral growth" from one of the donors: AB9105. "input" is # of CD4 cells, "p24" is ng/ml p24 from ELISA. if p24 = 0.01, it was below LOD.

AB9105_dat<- read.csv("qVOA figure/qVOA_figure_AB9105_data_only.csv")


AB9105_dat$Culture<- as.factor(AB9105_dat$Culture)


#Here I am changing culture #'s 6, 7, 8, 10 to be 1,2,3,4,5 so that I can have the same colors on each of the facets. They are different because the # of input CD4 cells is different, but all are from the same pt and I don't think we need to compare bwtwn cultures. Thus the legend is probably not necessary
